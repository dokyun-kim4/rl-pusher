# RL Pusher  
By Dexter Friis-Hecht and Dokyun Kim  

## Project Description  
In this project, we aim to deepen our understanding of reinforcment learning by implementing Imitation Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning in the [Minari Pusher environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/pusher/). The pusher environment has a 7-DOF manipulator whose task is to push a cylindrical object into the goal (marked in red).

## Methodology
In this section, we will cover basic concepts of reinforcement learning and detailed explanations of the two different methods we are using. 

### Terminology
We will define some terminology and notations that will be used in the following sections.  
**Agent**:  

**Environment**:  

**Action Space**:  

**Observation Space**:  

**Policy**:  

### Imitation Learning (Behavior Cloning)
The idea behind imitation learning is quite straightforward. Given an expert demonstration of the task we want the model to perform, can we make the model learn the expert's policy? We implement this using Behavior Cloning, which has one of the simplest architectures.  



### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN?)
